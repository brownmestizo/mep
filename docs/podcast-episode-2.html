                                <h4>Episode transcript</h4>
                                
								<p><b><span class="intro">Intro:</span></b> Hello and
									welcome to <span class=SpellE>MEPcast</span>. A podcast for Maternity Education
									Program of clinical skills development service. In each episode, we explore
									ideas and issues on how we can enhance and improve the delivery of maternity
									care education. </p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> Hello, and welcome
									to Queensland health clinical skills development, service, maternity education
									program podcasts, <span class=SpellE>MEPcast</span>. My name is Sue Hampton.
									I'm your host today. I am the midwifery educator here at CSDS and I am a
									registered nurse and midwife with over 40 years of experience in health care.
									We've developed this series of podcasts in relation to clinical situations and
									clinical experiences, aimed at healthcare providers in the maternity setting.
									Today, I'm going to be discussing how to keep <span class=SpellE>labor</span>
									and birth normal and, I've got a great colleague with me today, Angela Swift,
									who I've worked with over the last few years and working at the Royal Brisbane
									and Women's Hospital.</p>
									
									<p>Thanks for joining us today. And gee, it's great. </p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> A pleasure to
									be here, Sue. </p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> Would you mind
									just introducing yourself really to the listeners a little bit about your
									previous experience would be great. </p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> Yeah. Okay.
									Well, I trained in the UK. I was one of the first students in the direct entry
									program there in 1992.</p>
									
									<p><span class=GramE>So</span> I've been qualified now for 25
									years. I've worked in all aspects of maternity care in the hospital setting.
									But in the last seven years, <span class=GramE>really</span> I've concentrated
									my career around continuity models. <span class=GramE>So</span> I was part of
									the development and rollout of the <span class=SpellE>Ngarrama</span> Midwifery
									Group Practice here at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, which is for
									indigenous families.</p>
									
									<p><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>I then went <span
									class=SpellE>to</span> far north Queensland and developed <span class=GramE>a,</span>
									midwifery group practice that was outside of the hospital setting. <span
									class=GramE>So</span> it was in a country hospital, but women transferred to
									Cairns to birth. Then I've had a little stint on <span class=GramE>Thursday
									island</span>, in midwifery group practice up there. And then I've come back to
									work in the birth <span class=SpellE>center</span> here at the RBWH and I've
									been here a couple of years now.</p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> Well, it's great
									to have you back. I have to say we did miss you while you were gone. </p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> <span
									class=SpellE>Thankyou</span>. Miss you guys too. </p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> Great. <span
									class=GramE>So</span> over the past few years, there's been noticeably an
									increase in intervention during pregnancy <span class=SpellE>labor</span> and
									birth -for lots of reasons. I think our acuity is rising with our women and
									obviously the results of new evidence have showed that we've got increased
									induction rates happening because of what we're doing.</p>
									
									<p>What I've experienced is the reduced number of normal
									presentations and pregnancies and births. And in fact, we celebrate the normal <span
									class=SpellE>labors</span> now, which I feel quite sad about. How, how can
									midwives maintain some normality for the consumers of our care? Even with some
									of these <span class=GramE>high risk</span> births for their pregnancies and
									their <span class=SpellE>labors</span>.</p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> Oh, I mean, I
									strongly feel that women should always be at the centre of the decision making
									about their <span class=GramE>care, and</span> ensuring women that understand
									their rights as a consumer. That they're aware of what they should be expecting
									in relation to involvement in decision-making is really, <span class=GramE>really
									important</span>.</p>
									
									<p>I think. And a lot of women, I feel just go along with whatever
									the doc, you know, whatever they recommended to do without really being truly
									informed about the risks and the benefits. <span class=GramE>So</span> it's
									very easy, you know, when we're in a medical model for women to be recommended
									induction of <span class=SpellE>labor</span> for all sorts of reasons.</p>
									
									<p>And them just go along with it, rather than looking at the pros
									and cons of waiting, whether there's some alternative to going in and going for
									an induction, for example, <span class=GramE>Well</span>, they very rarely
									asked the question, well, what if we do nothing? And we just wait and see what
									happens. You know, other options for additional monitoring and stuff like that
									to ensure the wellbeing of the mother and baby, rather than just go for that
									induction at 38/ 39 weeks.</p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> <span
									class=GramE>So</span> in your practice, how do you manage to weave that in
									giving women good advice around that. Cause I think that's where we maybe don't
									do such a good job in the antenatal period. So how do you manage to do that? </p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> Well, when
									you, when women enter a continuity model, have a primary carer and certainly in
									the birth <span class=SpellE>center</span> and <span class=GramE>definitely in</span>
									my team from the outset before we even book them in and take them on, we have a
									conversation about what the expectation is.</p>
									
									<p>You know, we don't direct women to like education classes or
									anything like that, we encourage them to read around what they want for their
									birth. If they want a natural birth read around that subject and come back to
									us with what they want to do, whether that's hypnobirthing, calm birth thing,
									whether they're into meditation, yoga. All these things that will enable them
									to be in control of their bodies.</p>
									
									<p>What's happening to them. Grow that confidence as mothers and
									believe in themselves to be able to birth their babies. I think that's a huge
									thing for women to believe in themselves, you know, that they <span
									class=GramE>are able to</span> do this without intervention and without Having
									to do anything other than just be women.</p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> The interesting
									thing is you've mentioned your continuity of care model and you obviously work
									in the birth centre, which is a <span class=GramE>low risk</span> model. How do
									you think we can give all women access to continuity of care, even when they're
									in that <span class=GramE>high risk</span> situation? Because often they're the
									women. I think we kind of miss out the good continuity. </p>
									
									<p>Yeah. Well, I mean, I've worked in all risk MGPs with very <span
									class=GramE>high risk</span> cases and just having that one person that they
									can go to, makes a huge difference. Even when there's like involvement of multiple
									other specialties in their care, having that one person that can coordinate it
									all, bring it all together, explain things to them.</p>
									
									<p>Take time out, to have discussions with them about what they
									wants are. Then their <span class=GramE>particular needs</span> are, I think
									goes a real long way. And building that confidence and making them feel that
									they're in control. And they've got some say over what is happening to them. I
									would really love to see more midwifery group practices that are specialists.</p>
									
									<p><span class=GramE>So</span> specializing say for example in
									women who have drug and alcohol problems maybe like social issues. <span
									class=GramE>Certainly</span> for women who have language difficulties, you
									know, if we had just a little group of midwives that had a real good
									relationship with all the interpreters and, you know, could set up all of that
									whole care through that one interpreter with one midwife, I think would make a
									huge difference to outcomes.</p>
									
									<p>These are the groups of women that have the poorest outcomes
									for themselves <span class=GramE>and also</span> for their babies. We know, we
									absolutely know that having a continuity with, or a small team of midwives or
									one midwife will reduce the risk of stillbirth by about 14%. You know, they're
									less likely to go to the neonatal unit.</p>
									
									<p>They're less likely to need an epidural, more likely to have a
									spontaneous vaginal birth. <span class=GramE>All of</span> these things where
									we're seeing become less and less in, in the mainstream and you know, standard
									care models. Half of it, about 10% caesarean section rate in the birth centre.
									And I know that the <span class=GramE>low risk</span> women, but we have an awful
									lot of first time mothers and it's still that low. </p>
									
									<p>You mentioned the <span class=SpellE>Ngarrama</span> MGP that
									you worked in, and I think that gives you some comparisons really. Which, you
									had some <span class=GramE>high risk</span> cases in that group, didn't you? </p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> We absolutely
									did. </p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> Thinking back.
									And I know it's a few years since you did that. Can you, can you remember some
									of the differences you made to the outcomes for those women?</p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> Well, yeah, I
									mean, we won some awards with round table for the model that model of care for <span
									class=SpellE>Ngarrama</span>. And just within the two years that I worked
									there, we found that the outcomes for mums and babies were on par, if not
									better than, for mainstream care for that group of women that were you know,
									previously having the poorer outcomes and more likely to have premature births
									and special care. Two years in, we weren't seeing that at all. We were doing <span
									class=GramE>really well</span>. </p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> <span
									class=GramE>So</span> did you find with that model that those women tend to
									engage better with the health care professionals? Because I think that's
									something that's often an issue isn't there, in those <span class=SpellE>Ngarrama</span>
									situations is that women <span class=GramE>actually don't</span> engage, or
									families don't engage. So did you find that was one of the benefits. </p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> Yeah. I mean
									the women that chose to come to <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Ngarrama</span></span>
									and it was open to all indigenous families, whether it was the father, the
									mother who identified, it didn't matter, they were able to access it. And yeah,
									we found that the attendance was much better.</p>
									
									<p>You know, <span class=GramE>all of</span> the women had five or
									more antenatal appointments that they attended. They were confident, you know,
									to come in because they know there'll be somebody there that knew them, that
									they cared about them. They didn't have to keep repeating their stories or
									going over past traumas or incidences that they might've done had they'd been
									in, you know, the standard care model.</p>
									
									<p><span class=GramE>So</span> I think they just had greater
									confidence that they were going to be cared for in a culturally appropriate
									way. And of course, you know, we work with the health workers and liaison
									officers and stuff at the hospital as well. So now I think there's more
									midwives working in the team that identify as Aboriginal or Torres Strait
									Islander themselves, which is ultimately what the aim was that it would become,
									you know a very culturally appropriate place. Indigenous midwives in there <span
									class=SpellE>aswell</span>. </p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> That's a great
									job. And I think that there's a lot of other units around certainly Metro North
									that now provide that care, which is fantastic. And we need to build that even
									more. And <span class=GramE>certainly</span> your experience in far north
									Queensland probably exposed you to even more of that indigenous health care,
									which has lots and lots of issues, which you have to understand to be able to
									work in it. So having people who are in that culture helps them to be part of
									that as well. </p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> Yeah. And I
									think, you know, in on Thursday Island and also in Mosman where I worked; once
									they knew the community was aware that you know, you're a trustworthy service
									and, you know, word got out that you were okay, actually, you weren't, you
									know, they, they would come, you know, I would have women coming at five and
									six weeks pregnant to book in and they might not, they wouldn't have done that
									with our previous pregnancies.</p>
									
									<p>And that, you know, in the <span class=SpellE>longterm</span>
									in pregnancy, it makes big impact into the outcomes for the babies. Again, you
									know, I was there about three years, but certainly by the end of that third
									year, we were not getting premature births before 34 weeks. And they would
									have, you know, several, a year prior to that. Yeah, the outcomes.</p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> That's amazing.
									Really something to be <span class=GramE>really proud</span> of. </p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> Yeah. Yeah. </p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> I wanted to ask
									you a bit about <span class=SpellE>assiting</span> consumers and supporting
									consumers with difficult situations when they've got to make choices. Because I
									think in pregnancies, but particularly for women who are not in those
									continuity models or don't have great support, we do barrage them with lots of
									information, particularly towards the end of pregnancy, particularly around
									induction or emphasis area and section.</p>
									
									<p>Have you got an example you can give me about how you've
									supported somebody making choices that is <span class=GramE>difficult.</span> </p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> Yeah. Look, I
									do. </p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> How did you do
									it? </p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> Right. <span
									class=GramE>So</span> I do, I have one, particularly that's always stuck in my
									mind and it's kind of a bit of a, a bit of a game changer for me as well.
									Because you know, we always, I think as midwives we always think getting that
									normal birth, that's the pinnacle, you know, getting the vaginal birth.</p>
									
									<p>Pinnacle of success for us, but this is a slightly, this is a
									slightly different story, but I had when I was working low- risk MGP, I had a
									woman come to me and she was really just still distressed three years on since
									her last baby, she was a caesarean section and she'd spent the last three years
									beating herself up basically about whether she'd made the right decision.
									Should she have given into the doctor's advice to have that <span class=SpellE>caesar</span>
									when she did and all, you know, lots and lots of questions. She was in a
									continuity model back then, but she went two weeks overdue; was then induced
									which took time.</p>
									
									<p>She got to three <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>centimeters</span></span>
									and she was so tired, so exhausted. She said her midwife had run out of hours.
									There was no one that she knew to look after her. The doctor came in and said,
									oh, you know, we could just go for a <span class=SpellE>caesar</span>. And she
									went for one. And she's always wondered, she'd always wondered whether it was
									the wrong decision.</p>
									
									<p>And could she have had that vaginal birth, a natural birth that
									she really, really wanted? <span class=GramE>So</span> second time around, we
									had a good look at the notes and everything to see, you know, what was the
									problem? You know, what sort of cause. Was it okay to go for a vaginal birth
									after a <span class=SpellE>caesar</span>? And yeah, there was no reason why she
									couldn't; got her, you know, consent and everything with the consultant.</p>
									
									<p>And we <span class=GramE>made a plan</span> to avoid her going
									overdue. From 38 weeks, we were going to do twice weekly membrane sweeping to
									hopefully... so that she would <span class=SpellE>labor</span>. Because
									obviously she wasn't going to be suitable candidate for induction this time
									around. She was <span class=GramE>really happy</span> with that. So that's what
									we did.</p>
									
									<p>And then I think she got to about 10 plus five. Ruptured
									membranes came in clear, like where it was all good, started contracting. I got
									called in, in the morning to come in and take over her care. And she was
									contracting <span class=GramE>really well</span>. She got to fully dilated. No
									pain relief. She was ecstatic. <span class=GramE>So</span> she starts pushing
									and she's pushing, you know, she's pushing for an hour, half an hour to an hour.</p>
									
									<p><span class=GramE>And. This heads</span> not really coming any
									closer. I've got a fair bit of caput is happening. We have a bit of a chat with
									a consultant and decide that with her to have an epidural. So that she could
									have longer we could just wait, we could wait for a bit of descent, just see
									what happens.</p>
									
									<p>She could continue to be pushing, but rather than being
									exhausted, she'd be, you know, she'd be able to concentrate on the pushing. <span
									class=GramE>So</span> I think we waited an hour, started pushing again, had
									another hour of pushing. This baby still, really didn't come down. We're just
									getting more and more caput.</p>
									
									<p>And it's an, it was a persistent OP. And this is what happened
									with the first baby as well. <span class=GramE>So</span> after it was about
									four hours, the baby was always good. <span class=GramE>Obviously</span> we
									were continuously monitoring at that point. The heart rate was fine. liquor was
									clear. Everything's good, but this baby's just not coming despite excellent
									effort on her part. </p>
									
									<p><span class=GramE>So</span> you know, the consultant that came
									in again and we had another chat about it and you know, really there was no way
									to go. Now we've really needed to go for caesarean section the head was still
									too high to do a vacuum or forceps. And she was happy. She was like,
									&quot;okay, yeah, we're just going to have to do it. We've done
									everything.&quot; Her partner was still like, could we have a little bit
									longer? But she's like, no, I think we're done now, we'll just go. Anyway, she
									was awake compos mentis and everything. They're all in there for the <span
									class=SpellE>caesarian</span> section. Of course, baby comes out with a massive
									cone head. But it was <span class=GramE>fine</span> and her recovery was good.</p>
									
									<p>And when we debriefed <span class=GramE>afterwards</span> she
									was just, she said, she was just so happy with the experience because she'd
									made all of those decisions herself. She was confident that it was the right
									decision at the time. And as far as she was concerned, she'd done everything
									she'd wanted. She'd <span class=SpellE>labored</span> naturally. She'd done all
									the pushing, everything that you do in a normal birth, the only difference was
									it had to come out of the <span class=GramE>abdomen .And</span> it didn't come
									up out of the vagina. And that was, that was the difference. But she found it,
									said she just found it so healing and it then reassured her, as well, that the
									caesarean sections she had the first time, she could have done all of that. And
									it would have still ended up the same, same way.</p>
									
									<p><span class=SpellE>So.</span> That's <span class=SpellE>that's</span>,
									you know, one of those...</p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> I think that's a
									really great story to share because I think so often as midwives, we do get
									very caught up in the normal birth. It's all got to be normal. But as we know,
									not all babies come out normally. The most important thing is you have a
									healthy outcome, which is where I think we get a little bit <span class=SpellE>sidetracked</span>.</p>
									
									<p><span class=GramE>So</span> she actually feels like she got a
									very healthy outcome, both emotionally and physically, because she, she
									actually was the decision maker. And I do believe, and I think you're agree
									with me that this is sometimes where we go a little bit wrong with <span
									class=GramE>the,</span> decision-making taken out people's hands.</p>
									
									<p>And often, and <span class=SpellE>labor</span> is not the time
									to be making decisions, which goes back to that whole continuity of care
									models. And it's great for that, but we don't have that in every situation. We
									use the word advocate a lot. And I do think that that word is a great word, but
									I, I find that some of my junior <span class=SpellE>colleages</span>, sometimes
									they really understand what they need to do to be a good consumer advocate. <span
									class=GramE>So</span> could you enlighten them a little bit or what's been your
									experiences? </p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> Yeah. Well,
									look, you know, it's not always easy. We're in a patriarchal kind of system.
									And when you're young and new and maybe don't have the experience or the
									confidence to sort of stand up for your consumers, it can be quite <span
									class=SpellE><span class=GramE>a</span></span> intimidating situation. But I
									think you know, what I would say is that you listen to the woman, listen, and
									know what they want. And, you know, what she and her family want and be
									confident to just repeat their wishes. Well, thank you for that, you know,
									thank you for that advice.</p>
									
									<p>You know, we'll take a little bit of time here to discuss and
									well we'll get back to you with our decision rather than being sort of put on
									the spot or been encouraged really, I <span class=GramE>suppose,</span> to sort
									of stick with the medical decision. It's not always a medical decision.
									Sometimes it's a midwifery decision from senior midwives, you know. </p>
									
									<p><span class=GramE>So</span> we should be doing this now. And I
									recommend we do this, but if you know what your woman <span class=GramE>actually
									wants</span>, you can just sort of like, take a minute and say, thank you for
									that. We'll just have a chat about it. Get back to you with our decision and
									then repeat what the woman wants on her behalf. I guess I have an awful lot of
									consumers that are quite happy to speak for themselves.</p>
									
									<p>But you know, in, in sort of the mainstream, that's not always
									the case, because they've not had the antenatal experience of, you know,
									building the confidence and being informed and having <span class=GramE>all of</span>
									the education, so that they're pre-prepared to consider information and ask the
									questions. But I always, you know, encourage women and midwives <span
									class=GramE>actually to</span> always ask the doctor or the midwife to say,
									&quot;well, okay, thanks for that, but what are the alternatives? What if we
									don't do anything? And we just <span class=GramE>wait</span> and you know, can
									you sort of clarify the risks for us? You know what, what is that, you know,
									can you quantify that in some way?&quot; </p>
									
									<p>I'm trying to sort of <span class=SpellE>think</span> off the
									top of my head an example, say like for a large gestational age, baby. Yeah.
									They've been for an ultrasound scan, usually an ad-hoc one, because if I had a
									bit of reduced movements or something and it comes back, <span class=GramE>baby's</span>
									got a large abdomen and we have, you know, there's certain clinicians that
									would say recommend induction at 39 weeks, by 39 weeks, <span class=SpellE>'cause</span>
									this is going to be a big baby and you could have a shoulder dystocia.</p>
									
									<p>Most women will hear that and think, &quot;oh, I've got a huge
									baby on <span class=GramE>board</span> and I could have a shoulder dystocia. So
									yes, I'll have an induction.&quot; Without <span class=GramE>actually really</span>
									understanding that ultrasound scans can be highly inaccurate. That the chances
									of shoulder dystocia are <span class=GramE>actually quite</span> small, even
									with a large baby.</p>
									
									<p>The fact that we're all actually really highly trained to
									manage your shoulder dystocia, <span class=GramE>should they should</span> it
									occur? And they don't ask those questions. Like, what are the actual, you know,
									truly what are the risks? And, you know, that's the kind of situations that
									women are put in every day.</p>
									
									<p>And I think that's one of the reasons that we've got, you know,
									increasingly high induction rates. And <span class=GramE>so</span> what, you
									know, what I often do is because women have invested a lot of time and energy
									and often money into preparing for a natural birth and they don't want an
									induction. I sometimes tell them, just go in and have a read of <span
									class=GramE>evidence based</span> birth. They do some real good balanced,
									research based, consumer information on that website and they go <span
									class=GramE>away</span> and they have a read and they come back and go,
									&quot;Yeah. But the risk is small and it's just, you know, shoulder
									dystocia.&quot; <span class=GramE>So</span> they might not go in the bath for
									that reason, but there's no reason why they just can't wait for things to
									happen naturally and still birth in the environment that they want to be in.</p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> I think that's a
									great answer. And <span class=GramE>certainly</span> the question, the way you
									pose those questions. And I think it's the asking, why are we doing this? And I
									think for the midwives listening, if you're ever asked to do something, the
									thing I always teach juniors is ask the question. Why, if you can't answer that
									yourself, then you need to go and develop that conversation with, whoever's
									asked you that question as to why you're <span class=GramE>actually doing</span>
									something.</p>
									
									<p>I think an example for <span class=GramE>me</span> and you'll
									smile at this, is, you don't know, the women coming into the main system. It
									is, an exam <span class=GramE>do</span> their observations, do a monitoring.
									And next stage, I can remember when I was first working here. I was asked why
									hadn't examined somebody. Well, I hadn't <span class=GramE>actually really</span>
									assessed her properly because I needed to spend time with her and assess her
									contractions.</p>
									
									<p><span class=GramE>So</span> I think there is that it is
									sometimes they got caught up in that process that we end up in the, in the main
									system. And if nothing else, I think we can encourage our juniors to just set
									back sometimes. Why am I doing this? It's a <span class=GramE>really good</span>
									question, but that was a great answer because you talked a little bit about
									fear and what that does to people.</p>
									
									<p>What what's been your experience of when people are very
									fearful about coming <span class=GramE>in to</span> <span class=SpellE>labor</span>,
									what do you find happens with those women? </p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> <span
									class=SpellE>Labors</span> sort of wane don't they, when somebody is afraid, what
									happens is the adrenaline takes over and it subdues the oxytocin -it's the
									hormone that they need to feel safe and confident and helps contractions.</p>
									
									<p><span class=GramE>So</span> you very often, even, you know,
									even in the birth <span class=SpellE>center</span>, sometimes when, you know,
									women are so excited and they've had a bit of a scary journey in the car on the
									way in. When they get to the birth centre, those contractions that have been,
									you know, 3:10 for the last hour and a half sort of fizzle a little bit.</p>
									
									<p>But it is, it's about letting women be. I think, I liked 'you
									said, you know, the process, but <span class=SpellE>womens</span> are <span
									class=GramE>actually processed</span> in the main system. You're quite right.
									They come in you know, these things happen to them. Vaginal examination,
									observations, you know, transferred, sent home, given analgesia.</p>
									
									<p>That is not conducive with having a successful <span
									class=SpellE>labor</span>. Really. It's not, you need to, women need to be in a
									calm, quiet dimly lit space, surrounded by people that care for her. And <span
									class=GramE>so</span> you need to feel loved, you know, that's what gets
									oxytocin going. So very often when women come into the birth centre, they're
									usually in good <span class=SpellE>labor</span>.</p>
									
									<p>And if it's sort of fizzled out a little bit, I will just leave
									them alone in the, you know, I'll do a set of observations or public
									attractions, have a little listen in, and then I'll just say, you know, just
									set yourself up, have a rest, have a drink of a cup of tea, have a shower,
									whatever you want, settle yourself in.</p>
									
									<p>And then I'll go back. And then usually within an hour, things
									have started to heat up again because they've settled down; the oxytocin's back
									up; the adrenaline has settled. And you visibly, you can, you, you can see this
									happening. </p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> Obviously your
									birth centres are very much like a home from home environment, so it does have
									a great feel about it.</p>
									
									<p>How can we <span class=SpellE>kinda</span> improve environment
									in a, in a main system where we've got to be able to deal with <span
									class=GramE>high risk</span> women, as well as low risk women. How would you
									prep if you were taking somebody say into a birthing room, that's not a birth <span
									class=SpellE>center</span> style to get it to be less confronting for them and
									for their <span class=GramE>families.</span></p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> I guess I
									just, all the same things that we do at, you know, during the birth centre.
									Sorry, you know, I tell women to bring in things that are going to make them
									feel comfortable. <span class=GramE>So</span> whether that's like a pillow from
									home, whatever they want to wear, you know. I have women that have their
									birthing dress that they come in and they, and they bring it for all that, you
									know, all their <span class=SpellE>labors</span>. They wear the birthing dress.
									Or it might be a sarong or something that they feel comfy in.</p>
									
									<p>To bring aroma therapy oils that they like. We've got diffusers
									and things that <span class=GramE>actually can</span> make the room smell
									familiar. And <span class=GramE>again</span> you know, sometime if they, if
									they don't need the beds. If they're not on epidural and they want it, you
									know, want an active birth. Push the bed out of the way. Bring out the mattress
									into the middle of the floor and the bean bag and the ball. <span class=GramE>All
									of</span> these things are available in the main birthing suite, as well as in
									the birth centre. Utilize the shower. Water is an incredible pain <span
									class=GramE>reliever,</span> it works extremely well. Dim the lights; get some
									gentle music going, <span class=GramE>all of</span> these sorts of things that
									are just going to help the, the natural oxytocin to bubble up and get things
									going. </p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> Yeah. We touched
									on that lady who comes in and doesn't get going. And you've explained that you
									leave people for an hour. I mean, I've had the ladies have two or three hours
									and you're still going, or shall I send her home again? What sort of things,
									other strategies can you put in place to try and <span class=SpellE>reestablish</span>
									<span class=SpellE>labor</span>, if things (say after a couple of hours), she's
									really not <span class=GramE>contracting.</span> And you're thinking, you know,
									this lady is overdue. I need to release her. Get things going again. What sort
									of things have you done in the past? What do you think helps? </p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> Well, so we
									can do, we <span class=SpellE>we</span> use some aromatherapy also you know,
									clary sage, like a massage with, you know, some clary sage can work wonders.</p>
									
									<p>Nipple stimulation is absolutely proven to work, you know sometimes,
									you know, even get the breast pump out sometimes, but just rolling the nipples
									works wonders for getting contractions going. We can do some pressure points as
									well. You know that can help. <span class=GramE>There's</span> spots on the
									feet, like the little toes and the back of the heel that can help with uterine
									contractions too.</p>
									
									<p>And I've used things that, you know, pressure points to avoid
									putting Santos and on up in the second stage. And <span class=SpellE>and</span>
									it, and it works, you know, it does <span class=GramE>definitely work</span>.
									So those sorts of things, you know, you can implement as well, just, you know,
									getting people moving, go for a walk, those sorts of things can also sort of
									get things to heat up without having to go straight to the drug cupboard and
									get the oxytocin out. You can try the things first.</p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> I think
									something that always sits with <span class=GramE>me</span> and I learned this
									many, many years ago is the, you know, the primary, primary gravity has been in
									<span class=SpellE>labor</span> for probably, you know, overnight hasn't really
									eaten since the night before they arrive, you know, three, four o'clock in the
									morning.</p>
									
									<p>They've been contracting. Really important about testing their
									urine, because if they're dehydrated, often that's part of what the problem is.
									So do you agree with me that trying to get them, making sure they're not <span
									class=SpellE>ketocic</span> and then getting them to have a <span class=GramE>little
									sips of fluid</span> and even something to eat. Because we don't run a marathon
									without energy, and we are about to run a marathon probably backwards actually
									for your first, first <span class=SpellE>labor</span> birth.</p>
									
									<p>So that whole simple strategies, I think, we've kind of
									forgotten how to do that. I think in a way. I've often seen colleagues sending
									women on the stairs, which I think, you know, another good one is sending them
									for walk around stomping, doing the squatting positions. I know that one of our
									colleagues who's now retired, used to do a lot of that and it works.</p>
									
									<p>It does work if it means we're going to prevent intervention.
									It's a good philosophy. </p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> <span
									class=GramE>So</span> I sometimes actually, yeah, I absolutely agree that they
									are running on empty sometimes if they've been, you know, in early <span
									class=SpellE>labor</span> all night or for 24 hours beforehand. <span
									class=GramE>So</span> I often send them downstairs to level one to get
									something to eat, and I get them to crab walk all the way down. Because that
									can help rotate the head and stuff as well into a more optimal position for
									birthing. So, so </p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> Can you just
									explain to the listeners what you mean by crabwalk? Cause they're probably all
									imagining. </p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> Yeah. <span
									class=GramE>So</span> hold the banister and sideways walk down the stairs. '
									Bluey.' I do the crab walk.</p>
									
									<p>Yeah, so I get them to do that and that can be quite helpful as
									well. Particularly I find it really helpful with multi's, you know, they can
									sometimes go off the boil <span class=GramE>And</span> just, yeah, just doing
									that. </p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> That's a lot of
									stairs down to level one. </p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> It is, it is
									a lot of stairs, </p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> <span
									class=GramE>So</span> do they have to come up the stairs or use the lift? </p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> No, they can
									use the lift to come back up. But <span class=GramE>definitely I</span> send
									them down the stairs. </p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> Excellent. I'm
									sure you've had the experience of the client who does it <span class=GramE>really
									well</span>, <span class=SpellE>labors</span> beautifully. You've explained
									your one. The lady who had the scenario in <span class=GramE>section, but</span>
									has slow progress. And again, we have a bit of a clock on us at times and being
									faced with possible augmentation, possible intervention that they maybe don't
									want.</p>
									
									<p>You've talked about some strategies. What sort of things have
									you implemented in those <span class=SpellE>labors</span> where women are
									actually probably, you know, six <span class=SpellE>centimeters</span> and are
									getting slow <span class=GramE>progress.</span> What sort of things have you
									done to try and expediate? You've talked about pressure points and things.
									Anything else you can explain or give examples of?</p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> Well, I mean,
									I guess, you know, if we have somebody that's <span class=SpellE>labor</span>
									has stalled, we go, you know, you go back to your Clary Sage and you massage
									and all the rest of it. Then we can do ruptured membranes to a good membrane
									sweep and see how that works.</p>
									
									<p>Sometimes, you know, it's because the baby's perhaps not in the
									most optimal position. <span class=GramE>So</span> I've been learning some like
									spinning babies techniques and things like shaking the apple tree. <span
									class=GramE>So</span> you're just sort of shaking their legs during a
									contraction and the head can often, if it's a bit <span class=SpellE>asynclitic</span>
									can sort of settle into a more optimal position that way.</p>
									
									<p>I've learned to do a bit of Rebozo as well. And I've found that
									that works <span class=GramE>pretty well</span>. </p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> Can you just
									explain that to the listener? <span class=GramE>So</span> some people might not
									know what you're talking about. </p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> Yeah. So
									Rebozo is <span class=GramE>actually a</span> Mexican -Very old technique that
									midwives in Mexico use, and it's a very long shawl, but you can use it in
									different positions.</p>
									
									<p>And you <span class=GramE>really just</span> shifting -
									difficult when you can't see, but you sort of just jiggling, jiggling the, the
									abdomen, you know. Between contractions sometimes with contractions and, and it
									helps the baby get into a more optimal position for birthing. </p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> How do the women
									deal with that when they're contracting, are they okay with it? </p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> They like it.
									</p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> They like it? </p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> Yeah. And
									like the head down bum up position is fantastic, you know. Drops the head out
									of the pelvis so that when they come up again, hopefully it will have settled
									into it to a better position as well. So that kind of thing.</p>
									
									<p>We do a lot. <span class=GramE>Certainly</span> I use a lot
									more of those techniques now, I think working the last couple of years in the
									birth centre, because it's so focused on supporting women to achieve an actual
									birth, I've learned a huge amount. So, you know, I've been a midwife for a very
									long time, but you never, ever stop learning.</p>
									
									<p>And, yeah, you know, applied so many different techniques. And
									now when I have a woman that does need to go to the birth suite, we still
									employ all of those techniques and I show them, you know, we're still try and
									make this as natural of an experience as possible, even if you've got a monitor
									on and you've got a drip going, you know, we can still go in the shower, be
									upright.</p>
									
									<p>You don't have to be laying on the bed. And, you know, or have
									an epidural if you don't want one. And I assure them that they can <span
									class=SpellE>labor</span> with <span class=SpellE>syntocinon</span> without an
									epidural. </p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> Yeah,
									absolutely. </p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> They totally
									can. </p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> I think
									something you said which really rings true with me is, you know, doing that
									ruptured membranes at the right moment.</p>
									
									<p>Teach people that that's your race card. You need to keep it up
									your sleeve because it's the one thing you can do that can bring back <span
									class=SpellE>labor</span>. If you've, if you have stalled, the whole ARM thing,
									<span class=SpellE>'cause</span> the woman's dilated is if she's contracting,
									why are we doing it? It's back to that question of why am I <span class=GramE>actually
									doing</span> this?</p>
									
									<p>Is it <span class=GramE>actually essential</span>? <span
									class=GramE>So</span> I think that's a great one to hold onto. I think often
									people talk to women about, if you rupture the membranes, it's going to shorten
									your <span class=SpellE>labor</span>, blah, blah, blah. But we know, we both
									know, that that's not necessarily the case. There are situations where you <span
									class=GramE>have to</span> do ruptured membranes, but I think from the normal <span
									class=SpellE>labor</span>, who's low risk.</p>
									
									<p>Don't do it, leave it alone. </p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> Yes. </p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> Sit on your
									hands. The best one. And again, I think from, because a lot of people come
									from. Intimate we're free from a nursing perspective. They very much into that.
									Got to be doing all the time. I certainly learnt as a midwife in a midwife led
									unit. That's where I learned to sit on my hands and <span class=GramE>actually
									not</span> do anything.</p>
									
									<p>And I heard a GP obstetrician <span class=GramE>actually from</span>
									Stanthorpe one day, teaching some junior doctors here at CSDS. This was a while
									ago. He said, listen to the midwives, sit in the corner and be quiet. And I
									thought, awesome, because it's <span class=GramE>absolutely true</span>. You
									need to sit and watch, and I don't think we do enough <span class=GramE>sitting</span>
									and watching anymore.</p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> We <span
									class=GramE>definitely don't</span>, you know? It's yeah, like you say, women
									are processed and they're on the clock the minute that they get in there. I
									mean, I find like with second stage as well, you know I, I don't do a vaginal
									examination to confirm it. I just watched the woman you know, and I let her
									just do her thing.</p>
									
									<p>And, you know, if she's been like involuntarily pushing for 20
									minutes, half an hour, and there's like, no sign of baby's head, then, you
									know, and it's a first baby then, you know, then maybe I'd be considering doing
									a vaginal examination, so she's not pushing on an under dilated cervix.</p>
									
									<p>But <span class=GramE>generally</span> you can see -you just
									watch and you can see that they're fully dilated. You know, you can see that
									show that purple line comes up the back, the change in the <span class=SpellE>behavior</span>,
									the noises that are coming out. I really get frustrated when I hear midwives
									telling women to be quiet and hold their breath and you know, roll your baby
									out, you know, just do it.</p>
									
									<p>That's what we're meant to do. And there's absolutely nothing
									wrong with that. </p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> And I think that
									whole; I can remember working with a student a couple of years ago, and I <span
									class=GramE>actually said</span> to, we ought to just own our bits and pieces.
									And she looked at me very strangely because I was watching this lady. Doing
									nothing, I was just sitting, watching, and she, after we had a baby, it was her
									second baby <span class=GramE>fairly quickly</span> after that. And she said to
									me, what did you see? All, I saw that transition from the <span class=SpellE>behavior</span>.
									But because we do use drugs and we do use epidurals in quite large quantities,
									midwives are not experiencing that change in our women.</p>
									
									<p>So being able to recognize that, and that was a <span
									class=GramE>really good</span> example of looking for those signs. And there is
									no need to do another internal examination unless you don't have any sign that
									this baby's coming. <span class=GramE>So</span> I agree with you. I always say
									to people, this is very primeval. It's back to the animal kingdom and we are
									part of that.</p>
									
									<p>And that's why if we had choice, we probably go into a cave
									where it's dark and it's secure and it's warm. <span class=GramE>So</span> we
									need to make our environment like that as well. You talked a little bit about
									optimum <span class=SpellE>fetal</span> position. And I think Opie <span
									class=SpellE>labors</span> seem to be increasing. Whether that's, because we're
									not as fit, we don't get down on the floor and scrub our floors anymore.</p>
									
									<p>And we use, we sit in our chairs. What sort of things have you
									tried to <span class=GramE>actually improve</span> that position? Cause I think
									that does often cause awful problems for midwives trying to improve that
									position. </p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> Well,
									antenatally, I have Joe in my team who is the spinning <span class=GramE>babies</span>
									guru and you know, I've learned a lot from, from her experience and education
									as well. But we tend to give women like exercises to do, you know, lots of head
									down, bum up sort of stuff, lunges left sideline release. <span class=GramE>All
									of</span> these things have been shown to really encourage that baby to rotate
									into an anterior position before <span class=SpellE>labor</span>. You know, and
									in <span class=SpellE>labor</span>, we continue to do those types of things to
									encourage that baby around.</p>
									
									<p>We actually, you know, <span class=GramE>We</span> don't have
									very many Opie <span class=SpellE>labors</span> from our cohort women recently.
									Since we've been implementing these exercises antenatally. And I know it's, you
									know, it's only anecdotal, we haven't done like a study on it, but the women
									also feel that they are doing <span class=GramE>something</span> and it gives
									them confidence that stuff's going to happen. If they do this stuff, it'll all
									be okay. You know, rather than being told or your baby's posterior. <span
									class=GramE>So</span> this is going to be a long, painful back achy type of <span
									class=SpellE>labor</span>. You've said, right, well that's okay. We'll just do
									these <span class=GramE>things</span> and they just seem to work. </p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> I've got a
									question here about what <span class=GramE>would be some of the best props</span>
									you would put in a bag if you were actually going to want to keep things at
									certain things that you think are the best things you can use.</p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> Right! Well,
									I've always got, I always have the Clary Sage in the bag. <span class=GramE>So</span>
									it's, you know, great pain relief as I've said before. But the women feel
									relaxed, you know, if you've got the lights off in the shower, they're in that
									water and they just in that quiet, dark space, comfortable as they can be in <span
									class=SpellE>labor</span>.</p>
									
									<p>And yeah, I can't put that in a bag, but <span class=GramE>definitely
									it</span> would want it on hand all the time. What else would I have in my bag?
									I think I would have a TENS machine. We don't, I <span class=GramE>really
									strongly</span> encourage women, yeah, to invest/ borrow/ beg- not steal a TENS
									machine. Particularly first-time mums who quite possibly will have a longer
									latent phase of <span class=SpellE>labor</span>.</p>
									
									<p>It really helps them rest at home and keeps them at home until
									they're in <span class=GramE>really good</span> established <span class=SpellE>labor</span>.
									And, you know, I use them a lot. In the UK women use them a lot -not so much
									here, but they're having a bit of a resurgence. And I think Aldi had a bit of
									offer for one recently where they were about $40 or something like that.</p>
									
									<p>So <span class=GramE>definitely a</span> TENS machine as well.
									You don't need to have like a rebozo scarf, but just a sheet, something like
									that, you know, just little things like that. Something that, you know, for
									massaging, </p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> I honestly think
									we could talk forever. <span class=GramE>So</span> I'm very mindful of the
									time. <span class=GramE>So</span> I think what we'll do is I had a few more
									questions, but I think what would be really good just to have a second series
									of this around normal <span class=SpellE>labor</span> and birth.</p>
									
									<p>Cause there's so much we could talk about, but from today's
									discussion, what would be maybe one or two key take home messages to our
									listeners so that they have something that you think's <span class=GramE>really
									important</span> as a midwife </p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> Education, I
									think educating and empowering your women to be in control and involved in the
									decisions are being made around their care, making them feel that they are in
									control.</p>
									
									<p>Definitely. And they're <span class=SpellE>center</span> of it.
									It is not just about having a live baby at the end of pregnancy. It's how we
									get there that is important. And the women are central and in control of
									everything that is happening to them. <span class=GramE>So</span> I think
									that's maybe not just one point, but several. And I think just trust women,
									trust women to birth their babies, they can do it.</p>
									
									<p>You know, we haven't changed that much in the last 10 years
									that we've suddenly become disabled around <span class=GramE>childbirth</span>
									and we can't do it anymore. I think we've just, you know, need to trust women,
									stand back and watch. And you'll see that they, you know, they're able to give
									birth without <span class=GramE>all of</span> the bells and whistles and
									interventions that seemed to be employed in the majority of births these days. </p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> Sounds great. <span
									class=GramE>So</span> I think I'll just recap on some of our discussion today,
									if that's okay. Some of the things we've talked about is maintaining normality
									when intervention is required. And I think your example around the lady who had
									the <span class=SpellE>caesarian</span> section was a fantastic one to talk
									about. How continuity of care models can be, you know, we need to increase
									those. And it's obviously, you're very passionate about that and so am I. And
									hopefully in the next few years we will see more MGPs, which I think is
									probably the answer for those higher risk women and how we can support clients,
									making their decisions when there are difficult choices to make.</p>
									
									<p>It's not easy and it's <span class=GramE>definitely not</span>
									the best time when somebody <span class=SpellE>laboring</span>. <span
									class=GramE>So</span> the antenatal period is so, so important. How to improve
									our environment to assist the birth process. You've talked about calm quiet
									music, just even in our bigger birth suite environment. <span class=GramE>So</span>
									you can make that work and how to be a good advocate for our clients. We're
									there to support them. We're there to make sure things are safe. I often say
									I'm like your guide for the day. I'm not here to tell you what to do, but I'm
									here to guide you. And how to bring the deviating <span class=SpellE>labor</span>
									back to a normal track before it's too far off the track that we can't <span
									class=GramE>actually do</span> that.</p>
									
									<p>And the good props. I think that was <span class=GramE>really
									good</span> to say what you put in your bag. It's certainly a challenging
									environment being a midwife today. I've seen a big change in the time I've been
									a midwife, but we have to move with the <span class=GramE>times</span> and we
									have to work with the skills that we have and the, and the cohort of women and
									staff that we have as well.</p>
									
									<p><span class=GramE>So</span> for our listeners, if you talked
									about our website early, any good examples of anything you'd think would be
									good for people to read or anywhere to go that you think would be excellent for
									them? </p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> Yeah. <span
									class=GramE>So</span> <a href="https://evidencebasedbirth.com/">Evidence-based Birth</a> is <span class=SpellE>is</span> a really good website that I
									really like, there's some really good stuff there. That's just written very,
									very simple language, but it's packed full of the evidence and it's just very
									unbiased. And I like that. <a href="https://www.spinningbabies.com/">Spinning Babies</a> is a great website as well. You can just register interest with <span
									class=GramE>them</span> and they'll send you all sorts of you get a little tips
									on emails of different things that you can do.</p>
									
									<p>Where else do I go? This just trying to think. Can you think of
									any, Sue? </p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> There's so many
									out there to count, two is fine. And if you think of <span class=GramE>any more</span>,
									you can always send them to me and we can actually post it on the website. But
									I think that's amazing. And I just want to say a big thank you for your time
									today.</p>
									
									<p>And it's been great. Like I said, I think we could have spoken
									for a lot, lot longer. And certainly, I think we will re revisit this topic
									again, because it's something we need to build on. And yeah, the maternity
									education programs we've said is, is building a podcast with all sorts of
									things. <span class=GramE>So</span> if you think of anything or your
									colleagues, then we'd be very happy to continue with the podcast.</p>
									
									<p><span class=GramE>So</span> thanks again. </p>
									
									<p><b><span style='color:#D82292'>Angela:</span></b> Thanks for
									having me.</p>
									
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> And that's <span
									class=GramE>really good</span>.</p>
