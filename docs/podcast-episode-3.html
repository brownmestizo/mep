                                <h4>Episode transcript</h4>
                                
								<p><b><span class="intro">Intro:</span></b> 
								Hello, and welcome to MEPcast, a podcast for the Queensland Maternity Education of Clinical Skills Development Service. In each episode, we explore ideas and issues on how we can enhance and improve the delivery of maternity care education.</p>
								<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> Sheena was the very first midwife consultant in the UK and actually has her own business which she runs with her daughter. And we'll give you the links to those later on. So without further ado, I'm going to start off by just asking Sheena a few questions particularly around the UK midwifery system. So, hi, Sheena, and welcome and thank you very much for joining us. We really appreciate you doing this for us today.</p>
								<p><b><span class="guest">Sheena:</span></b> Oh, hi, Sue. Hi. It's really good to meet you after the emails that we've been sharing. So yeah, and thank you for inviting me and always delighted to do anything in Australia, because I have a particular fondness because my niece is a midwife there and we tend to come quite a lot - obviously before this virus, before COVID.Thank you for inviting me.</p>
								<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> Where is she a midwife?</p>
								<p><b><span class="guest">Sheena:</span></b> She's in Geelong.</p>
									<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b>  Okay. Excellent. Excellent. All right. So just really would like you to sort of answer a few questions for me, which we will have a bit of a discussion around. And can you tell me about midwifery in the UK now, in 2021? And what it's looking like?</p>
								<p><b><span class="guest">Sheena:</span></b> Yes, I can.</p>
								<p>Can I just, first of all, say I wasn't the first consultant midwife. Thank you for that lovely introduction. I was one of the first and that seems a long time ago now. And I've, yeah, so I've been what I worked in clinical practice for many years. And, and then finally was Head of Midwifery, and a consultant midwife towards the end of my NHS career.</p>
								<p>And since then, I've been doing consultancy and writing and working in different countries sort of delivering sessions, etc. So, yeah, so it's about 10 years since I've been out of the NHS. But I'm very much in touch with midwives because of the fact that Anna, my daughter, and I have this organisation called <a href="https://www.all4maternity.com/">All4Maternity</a>. So we have to keep abreast of what's going on. Plus, the fact that I'm in touch with midwives in the NHS constantly. I'm delivering sessions for them and talking to them on almost a daily basis.</p>
								<p>And yeah, it's quite tough at the moment, and I mean, even before Coronavirus hit. It was tough because there's a shortage of midwives and it's felt on the ground, you know, and also the expectations of midwives as completely--- you know, since you and I made... maybe you too Sue at work, as a clinical midwife--- it's just changed exponentially. And midwives are expected to do more and more and more and more particularly around record keeping, technology, doubling up of everything, protecting themselves, and protecting organisations. That it seems to me that they're moving away constantly from being by the side of the woman and her family. So that was happening already. And the fear that's kind of threading through maternity services is certainly felt by midwives and midwives burning out feeling like they can't go on. And leaving, you know, leaving the profession has been pretty dramatic.</p>
								<p>And then, of course, this awful virus struck, which amplified everything and made it, you know, sort of made it much worse. And of course, now the situation is quite dire. Because there's even more shortages on shifts. And again, it's leading to burnout and moral distress.</p>
								<p>I've given you kind of the realistic negative picture that's happening at the moment. But on the other hand, on the flip side, there's amazing things still happening- good things, good practice. So for example, I don't know whether you know, but our country, England - not the United Kingdom, but England and Scotland, has a governmental policy to implement continuity of care schemes. And that's continuity of carer.</p>
								<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> Yeah.</p>
								<p><b><span class="guest">Sheena:</span></b> And which is five years old now. And it was really exciting when it obviously was announced. But there's been kind of variations in how it was implemented in different organisations. But there have been some really significant positive moves towards continuity of care. And it really gives me a lot of joy to tell you that there's something like 375 successful continuity of carer teams in England at the moment working. And it's transforming. It's transforming midwives' lives. It's transforming services. It's transforming women and birthing people's care.</p>
								<p>It's really quite revolutionary, I think. And it lifts my spirits because I use social media a lot. So I see that a lot is going on social media. And I see that midwives who are practicing like this, are able to talk about it on social media. And they're saying how, how fantastic it is. Women are saying how fantastic it is.</p>
								<p>So we've a long way to go, because there's still a resistance in some areas. There's still some organizations [that] can't manage to do it for various reasons. Sometimes it's resources. Sometimes it's the wherewithal. But you know, there is this chink of light, which I always hold on to that whatever is happening in some organizations, surely, you know, we can learn from that. And we have a continuity lead in England who is actually driving this forward. And she's really sort of working hard to do that and to bring people together.</p>
								<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> So you talk about the continuity model. So these caseload midwives- how many are in a team? Caseload?</p>
								<p>Sheena:<br /> Yes, caseload. Yeah, that group practice, like you have midwifery Group Practice?</p>
								<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> Group Practice. Yes.</p>
								<p><b><span class="guest">Sheena:</span></b> So it's like where a team of midwives look after a set amount of women and they manage their own caseload. They manage how their case care for those women. And they're right across the, I hate using the word risk, but they're right across the risk spectrum. So they don't pick and choose. There are some teams that are actually focusing their attention on women, women who are disadvantaged in some way, again I don't like that word. But you know, they're marginalized, either by language or you know, whatever's happening in their life at the moment. And some teams focusing on that. And those that are just generic, but it's really interesting. And we're trying to keep the momentum going.</p>
								<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> So when you when you're invited to lecture and talk to the midwives within the hospitals, what sort of areas do you tend to talk about? You're doing stuff around continuity care models? Or are you talking to them about resilience? What are you talking to them about when you go?</p>
								<p><b><span class="guest">Sheena:</span></b> Yeah, personally, I've got two areas that I'm really interested in, one is normal birth; normal physiological birth, that's my kind of real passion. And the other thing is, which, as of... which I am still, you know, equally as excited about is supporting midwives to feel that they're able to continue working as midwives- motivational sessions. I deliver motivational sessions.</p>
								<p>And you mentioned the word resilience. Yes. So trying to build resilience. But it's become quite a toxic word in the United Kingdom because there are some midwives that are reporting that managers are using it like as a stick or university lecturers and saying, "You are not resilient enough because you can't cope". And that kind of thing. So resilience has become sort of, you know, "Oh don't talk about that". "It's, you know, they're just trying to make us do things" and "There isn't enough time and there isn't enough".</p>
								<p>So but what my stance on it is that we all need resilience in our lives, you know, I need your resilience to get linked up with you this morning when technology is not working, you know. We need it for everything.</p>
								<p>I need it when I'm looking after my grandchildren. And I think that, you know, we can't just dismiss it if it's used wrongly. We have to try to educate and, you know, we need to know how to build our resilience, how to cope with things when they're happening the instance. And then how to nurture ourselves afterwards and learn from what's happened. And if things aren't right, if things aren&rsquo;t right, then we need to speak up about it.</p>
								<p>And so I am very interested in compassionate leadership, in the concept of compassionate leadership. And there's a couple of people in the United Kingdom who are doing a lot of work in this area. And I follow them avidly and learn from them. And it's something that kind of, I think it's how I practiced anyway. And it's something that I knew about but didn't put a name to it.</p>
								<p>And so compassionate leadership is all about having these four tenets and it's about compassionate care as well.</p>
								<p>And that is being with the person- really listening, listening with fascination and empathizing with them. And also doing something about it. Acting on what you hear. So it's not about being fluffy and soft and saying yes to everyone.</p>
								<p>And it's not about being kind all the time. It's about actually being present. And I think it matches up with woman-cantered care because it's very similar isn't it to that rapport we have with women?</p>
								<p>If we work with individuals, when we're in practice, when we're managing them, or leading them, or, you know, whatever position we're in. Then if we can try to shift organizations and or even the shift that you're working on. Even that you know, that the time that you're working with others, if you can use this kind of way of being with others, then what happens is, it's like a feedback loop. So the more empathetic you are, and the more compassion you show and the more you act on what you're hearing if you're able to. Then actually it transfers to others that you're working with. You modelling behaviours is one thing, but the next thing is that it actually changes the feeling, the culture of the shift, it changes it if you can do that. And it doesn't have to be the person in-charge that does it. It can be anybody that starts that ball rolling. So I'm really interested in that.</p>
								<p>And I do a lot of sessions on that and how to have little strategies. Have little things that you can do to help you and your practice on a day-to-day basis. Using those, that compassion model. Things on how you can look after yourself, how you can look after your colleagues, and then how you can look after the people that you're caring for in this kind of a way.</p>
								<p>Some folks might think or might, might read that actually, you can get compassion burnout. And that if you're giving yourself all the time, then it wears you out. Well, actually, when you read the science behind it, and when you do it in practice and if it's authentic compassion then what happens is the opposite, because it comes back to you. Things come back. So you get that feeling back. It stimulates. It kind of triggers in your brain that feeling of empathy comes back to you. So I just think it's a fantastic way of trying to transform the way you're working and the people you're working with.</p>
								<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> So I think it was very interesting what you said at the beginning how a lot of midwives are leaving the profession and you've got a lack of midwives. Can you tell me what the pathway is for someone who wants to become a midwife in the UK? What's their pathway to get into midwifery now in the UK?</p>
								<p><b><span class="guest">Sheena:</span></b> Well, there's two ways. They can either go direct entry into doing a full-degree program and or they can be already trained nurses and do it like an extension, like a top-up to become a midwife. So there's those two ways.</p>
								<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> So when they do a post-grad, so if they're an RN, already, how long is that course now?</p>
								<p><b><span class="guest">Sheena:</span></b> I think it's two years. I'm not actually sure I'd have to check upon that Sue. </p>
								<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> So don't quote you.</p>
								<p><b><span class="guest">Sheena:</span></b> I'm not sure that that's changing. And I'm not kind of up to date with that. My daughter's a lecturer would know more than me. But yeah, I think it's changing. I think it might be two years. When I did it, it was a year. I don't know about you Sue.</p>
								<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> 18 months I did, yeah. </p>
								<p>So are there lack of numbers- people wanting to do midwifery? Or is there just no places? Or no?</p>
								<p><b><span class="guest">Sheena:</span></b> No.</p>
								<p>There's not a lack at all. In fact, the places would be totally inundated with applications. And that's year on year. There's an issue with training places, that's increased just recently. So over the past 12 months, the numbers of training places have increased. So we're training more midwives now than we were. And every hospital organization has to facilitate more... more space for learning for students.</p>
								<p>But I do think that we need to move from... sometimes if we said "Oh, yes, we can have more midwives", of which there's a constant. And we're constantly lobbying to get more midwives- the Royal College of Midwives is and others pressuring the government.</p>
								<p>And if the government say to us, yes, you can have X amount. To get from A to B, takes a long time. And in that time, the midwives who are already working hard... you know that there is this attrition rate where midwives leaving so it's almost like you're pouring water into a bucket that's got holes in it. And that's constant. So what, certainly in England, what we have achieved is a midwifery officer now. That's another exciting thing. That's another positive that we've got. This amazing now leader who really understands the nitty gritty of what's going on. And she's obviously got direct links with the policymakers. And she's very influential and she's brilliant. And what she's doing is trying to influence that number.</p>
								<p>But she also wants to keep the midwives who are working, in practice. So one of the things she's done is she's created this role called Midwifery Ambassador. Midwifery Ambassadors are midwives who are working in practice who feel that they can support other midwives. So it's not a sort of specific role that you sort of get... what do you call it, when you go up the ladder kind of thing? What do you call it?</p>
								<p>Sue:<br /> Not like supervision?</p>
								<p><b><span class="guest">Sheena:</span></b> No, not supervision.</p>
								<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> More like a mentoring role?</p>
								<p><b><span class="guest">Sheena:</span></b> Yeah. Yeah. Trying to improve the culture of the maternity unit. And there can be more than one ambassador in a maternity unit. Midwives can apply for this to the Chief Midwifery Officer's team to become a Midwifery Ambassador. And then what happens is: she's got to get a letter from her Head of Midwifery to say, "Yes, this is the kind of midwife she is". And what those people are doing is trying to lift up the midwives who are already there in innovative ways.</p>
								<p>So my daughter, Anna and I have been doing some sessions with those Midwifery Ambassadors to help them. And we've provided this little toolkit for them to use in practice. And these things are sort of small things to help cheer the others along. But that's not to say that, you know, they still haven't got to say when things aren't right. We've got to remember that you can't just put a bandage on a leaking wound and think it's going to get better. You have to also at other levels, say when things are difficult.</p>
								<p>So these Midwifery Ambassadors- that's what they're doing. And we're just about to publish some blogs that they've been writing actually. Because, you know, keeping midwives in practice is really important, isn't it? Helping them...</p>
								<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> Absolutely.</p>
								<p><b><span class="guest">Sheena:</span></b> ... nurturing them and helping them to feel valued. Because sometimes it's that they don't feel... and this goes for the managers as well... that they don't feel that they're valued. And they're constantly being bashed. So this work is around appreciation. They're just appreciating simple things that midwives are doing on a day-to-day basis, but doing it authentically, not just saying everything's brilliant or whatever, but really valuing small things.</p>
								<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> It sounds really good that you've developed like those kit of resources for some for those ambassadors. Because I think sometimes these positions get put in, and people interpret them and you end up with all sorts of different models happening. So having something that's a little bit structured definitely helps those people who are doing new positions. But that sounds like a really valuable position actually. It's probably something that we could look at, but certainly, supervision used to be really great, but I think like you said, you need somebody in the clinical space with those midwives.</p>
								<p><b><span class="guest">Sheena:</span></b> Yeah, supervision is still-- so we still we have professional midwifery advocates, because once supervision went PMAs were developed and Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent, who is our Chief Midwifery Officer, she worked really hard to create these positions, because we all felt sad, that supervision was going, for so many reasons. And we know it had it's down downsides to it, but in the main it was a fantastic role. And sometimes midwives are stuck now without supervision, really when the advocacy for women comes in, it&rsquo;s that bit I think, is really missing. But the PMA role is fabulous. And they're doing some wonderful things in there. And similarly, they're helping to nurture midwives to keep practice safe, you know, to sort of maintain that status quo and to improve cultures. But the midwifery ambassadors are extra to that, that sometimes they do both roles sometimes amaze our PMAs as well. So you know it's, they do both things, but it's all about, you know, trying to improve and trying to support and nurture. Those are the things really those roles are focusing on, which I think is great because it's what's been lacking for such a long time.</p>
								<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> Because ultimately, you support your staff, and they're going to provide better care for your women at the end of the day.</p>
								<p><b><span class="guest">Sheena:</span></b> Exactly.</p>
								<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> So it's all that that whole support and encouragement to continue, you know, bringing on the profession, because it's a tough job. It's not an easy job. And I think I think over the years, the job has got harder personally, and I think you will probably agree with me. So, you know, just talking about the women's care and how they access care now, where is mostly talked about MGPs and case loading? Where do most of the women access their antenatal care? For example, in the UK now? Is it mainly GPs or GP surgeries? Or home? Or where do they get that from?</p>
								<p><b><span class="guest">Sheena:</span></b> Yes, so they go mainly, they will go to the GP to tell them they're pregnant. And you know, or to get a pregnancy test, but then they will see a midwife. So the midwives are the first point-of-contact. So when I was when I was a young clinical midwife at the beginning, it was the GP, it was the first contact. But now, for many, many years, it's been midwifery led. So midwives are what you would call the gatekeepers. So they're the ones who assess this, assess the situation and offer the care, the package. So we have midwifery-led care, and we have consultant-led care. And most women really would be suitable for midwifery-led care, but like everywhere else in the world, the risk agenda is getting bigger and bigger and bigger. It's like a juggernaut wagon that is hurtling towards us, and it's already with us. And, and the risk, the risk factors grow and grow and grow, which diminishes midwifery-led care, and acceptability to you know, sort of, to women and families. So that is a challenge that we're all facing everywhere. I know you are as well in Australia.</p>
								<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> Yes, definitely.</p>
								<p><b><span class="guest">Sheena:</span></b> And we fight against that. And sometimes, you know, it's, it feels like you're not getting anywhere, because it&rsquo;s just like, you know that the technocratic model of care is, and the medical model is the loudest and seems to be the most powerful, and wherever, wherever midwives and midwifery-led care is asserted, it's always done with either trepidation or with some kind of lack of belief, that it's going to work. So it's very important that we continue to do our own research, to have powerful leaders. And when I talk about powerful leaders, I don't mean power over, but leaders who are strong and knowledgeable and able to articulate what, what is important.</p>
								<p>For example, you know, we know, within the Maternal and Newborn Framework, you know, that came out of the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/series/midwifery">Lancet Midwifery Series</a>, when you look at the Quality Framework, and you look at what midwives can do, we can do everything, you know, there's just one tiny, most things, there's a tiny top corner that doctors are needed for, and we can kind of span the whole spectrum apart, apart from the obvious, you know, the sort of surgical techniques etc, and dealing with illness. But where is all the research, it's all in that top right hand corner. So because that's where all the money goes to. And that's where all the loud voices are, and that's where all the highly educated people are. So what we have to do is constantly, you know, group together&hellip; raise our voices.</p>
								<p>I'm not an academic Sue. So my strength lies in connection - in sharing this knowledge. So, I work very, very closely with a lot of your professors in Australia, you know, with Hannah Dahlen, Jenny Gamble, Caroline Holmer, Nicky Leap. You've got the most phenomenal midwifery professors, and Liz Newnham; and they are, oh, I just love them all. And I'm so thankful to them on a daily basis because what they're doing is they're working at this level, and they're so attune with what needs to be done and they're bidding for funds to do the research. And then they're writing papers at a rate of knots and writing books. And what we have to do is read those papers, interpret them and then share that information so that midwives working on the shop floor have access to it. And that's what we do at <a href="https://www.all4maternity.com/the-practising-midwife/">The Practicing Midwife</a> and <a href="https://www.all4maternity.com/">All4Maternity</a>. That's what me and my daughter are really passionate about. Because as a lecturer, she's also done a PhD but she's mainly an educator and a sharer. And so together, what we try to do is build that momentum of getting information out, that's understandable. You know? I don't know about you, but when I was working within clinical practice, I didn't have access to a lot of information. And also, I didn't understand it sometimes, you know, because it was at such a high level that I thought, well, I don't really know what that means that I switched off. But what we do is we provide it in a really accessible way so that you've got it at your fingertips on your phone, and you can just search for things straightaway.</p>
								<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> This is certainly something that we talked about keeping it simple, you know, you have to keep it simple for clinicians. They've got technical abilities, but their expertise is clinical work not being good on PCs and being able to access stuff and I agree with you being able to read good information and stuff that's relevant is so important.</p>
								<p>So I think that you unpacking that and putting that into a readable manner is, is fantastic. And I do agree with you, we do need to work together to try and, you know, fight our corner in a way, because it is it is a difficult area and we're all very passionate about what we do for sure.</p>
								<p>Sheena:<br /> Well, you know, midwife saves lives, we've got the evidence there, don't we. It is absolutely clear, we save lives, we make a difference. We have to - And we have to stick together to keep talking about it. I don't know about in Australia, but in the United Kingdom, we have a growing number of doulas. And I love doulas that I've got some of my dear friends are doulas. I love working with them, I don't see why women shouldn't have doulas and midwives together. But what I feel sad about is that, you know, doulas are able to do things that we should be doing, that we want to do. And we could both do it. You know, it's not to say, you know, we need to do it and that you don't. Both do it together. But you know, just feel sad sometimes.</p>
								<p>So just to give you a quick example, there was a prospective father who contacted me from Scotland. And he said&hellip; and it was from an area in Scotland where there was no continuity. He was seeing different midwives and he wanted a home birth. His wife wanted a home birth and they couldn't find anybody to support them to have a home birth. And he said, because everybody was putting barriers up every time they talked about it. And you know that in the United Kingdom, that's an option. So, he said, it's because I'm seeing different people. And so I said, What would you do? What one thing would you would you do? He said to me in order to get what you want? And I just said &ldquo;get a doula.&rdquo; And that is really sad. You know, for me as the midwife to say, you know, you need to get a doula, but I was trying to think what one person would advocate for them, and they will get to know if there's no continuity. So yeah, that's sad. Anyway, sorry for interrupting.</p>
								<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> My first time of meeting doulas was when I came here, actually to Australia. I'd never experienced that. But I think I moved from the UK when midwifery was midwifery and you did that job. Whereas we've, like you've said in the beginning, we're moving away from hands on, being with the woman, because we're being pulled away to technology, paperwork, etc. So the doula position is definitely growing for that reason.</p>
								<p>You talked a little bit about home birth. So midwives in the UK, still providing home births through their hospitals? So they are still employed by the hospital?</p>
								<p><b><span class="guest">Sheena:</span></b> Yes.</p>
								<p>Sue:<br /> What are the&hellip; What other options are there besides home birth? Where are other places people are birthing?</p>
								<p><b><span class="guest">Sheena:</span></b> In midwifery-led units. Yes. So birth centres, and which seem to - the number of birth centres seems to fluctuate. So when the policy came in, around continuity, for example, the same policy also advocated for women to have choice in four places of birth, that was home birth, hospital birth, alongside midwifery-led units and free standing. So the number of alongside grew rapidly, and free standing not so much. But the number of free standing, I think the last time I looked, has stayed the same. Because sometimes some close and some open, but they're always under threat for closure, because they're the first things to go, which is tragic, because actually, it is, they have the best outcomes. So freestanding birth centres have the best outcomes in terms of&hellip;</p>
								<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> I worked in one for nine years. So I'd totally advocate for that. Yeah!</p>
								<p><b><span class="guest">Sheena:</span></b> Oh really? I did too.</p>
								<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> It's a really interesting concept. I think. And I think something here in Australia, we still grapple a little bit with that whole home birth because it's not supported by the hospitals here. The midwives are independent. They're basically working in private practice, usually. So it's a very difficult subject because obviously those midwives are well supported, but they've got to provide all their stuff themselves. So I always feel that UK is still doing a great job. Have you any idea what sort of percentage over the maybe the England women have home births now? Have you any idea what that is?</p>
								<p><b><span class="guest">Sheena:</span></b> I think it's still around 2%. But it went up during the pandemic, interestingly, more people considered it and, you know. But some services withdrew their homebirth service, because there were, you know, they went into, we have to just make sure that the hospitals are okay, which was really sad. It was understandable, but very, very sad.</p>
								<p>But slowly they've opened up their services again, but more women have considered it because they didn't want to go into hospital because of the fear of the environment.</p>
								<p>And I hope that that kind of dialogue continues and that the home birth rate goes up. We've got more home birth teams now, which are doing, again, phenomenal work. So when a service has got a team of midwives who do the home birth, then that's much, much better.</p>
								<p>And we feel very proud of that the fact that we can deliver services in the home. And I think sometimes midwives in England and the United Kingdom, right across the UK, aren't aware of how lucky they are to be able to do that. It's only when you go, like speaking to you today. And when I've travelled to other countries and spoken to midwives that they've, and they've told me about the restrictions, the terrible restrictions, you know, because sometimes it's unlawful to have a baby at home. We have a fabulous system in the UK, it just needs tweaking at the edges. Do you know? It needs valuing, first of all, by society, and also by organisations. And then by the midwives themselves to realize that actually, this is an amazing job, and also is worth fighting for, you know, but I do wonder.</p>
								<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> Absolutely</p>
								<p><br /> Sheena:</p>
								<p>On the other hand, I do understand if midwives feel totally browbeaten and they feel that they have to leave. That again shouldn't be seen as a failure. It's, you know, everyone deals with things differently, don't they? But I do think it's worth trying another organization, if you're unhappy with the one you're in, and you're feeling burnt out. Try some other area of midwifery practice. Because I'm a practicing midwife and I haven't had, you know, sort of direct contact with a woman for 10 years, but I'm still doing midwifery.</p>
								<p>Do you know, we can do it in different ways, can't we?</p>
								<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> I completely agree with you with moving. I think, as you've said, you've got different health districts doing different things. You move to a different space. I certainly myself, personally, had I stayed in the same place where I trained, I wouldn't still be a midwife today. So I moved to a completely different place. And it was a completely different setup. So I think that's a very valuable piece of information to pass on to the listeners today about changes good and move on. And I think it does you good to change and you take new things to new places, which is really important.</p>
								<p>One of my questions, which I know we've kind of touched on, and we're looking sort of looking into the future. And we've talked about increasing acuity and, you know, risk minimisation and all the things that we do and how women tend to fall out of that low-risk category. How can we keep labour and birth normal in your opinion? What would you give some advice to some of our most junior midwives, who are trying to keep labour at birth normal?</p>
								<p><b><span class="guest">Sheena:</span></b> Okay, that's a really good question. I love that question. So first and foremost, it would be to revisit physiology, revisit the physiology of labour. That's not just the mechanisms of labour, but it's also about the hormonal influence. First of all, think about the fact that we're mammals, and we have the same instincts as other mammals. And that we should honour those instincts, those same physiological processes that, that have, you know, sort of been there since time began.</p>
								<p>And, you know, in Australia you've got the guru of physiology. So you've got Dr. Sarah Buckley, she lives in Brisbane, and her website is full of amazing resources. First and foremost, go back to that, learn it off by heart, and then every single woman that you see, respect her physiology, so even if she's having lots of intervention, necessary intervention, then you can still respect that physiology.</p>
								<p>So for example, if she's having an elective caesarean section talk to her about the importance of skin-to-skin contact, zero separation, about optimal cord clamping, about breastfeeding. You know, all the things that that are very important for that physiological connection between mother and baby. Do that.</p>
								<p>So have that. Because that's the fundamental science that we should all&hellip; And what happens is we learn about it maybe, I think, I think student midwives will learn about physiology. But there's so many other things that they're learning about that it becomes sort of, &lsquo;Oh well, that's just that.&rsquo;</p>
								<p>But actually, if we don't get that, right, we don't get any. And we don't get anything, right. Because that's how we should... It's the same with us, isn't it. When, you know, if something's happening in our lives, and we get angry, or we get upset, the physiology affects how we how we act.</p>
								<p>So remember that that's what happens to the woman. So she's not going to be able to go through the process in the optimal way, if we don't do that, if we don't respect that.</p>
								<p>And so, I think that that's the first thing. And the second thing is, you know, read, write.</p>
								<p>So again, you've got another phenomenal person in Australia, Rachel Reed. So Rachel Reed, just brought out a new book, hasn't she, in fact, it's next to my bed here. I've got it on my phone as well, because I read it all the time. Childbirth is a rite of passage. And she goes right back from the time began. It's just come out, this book.</p>
								<p>And, you know, this book kind of gives you the history of childbirth. And so when you read it, it kind of challenges you to think, &lsquo;well, what are we doing all this for?&rsquo; And we really, have to really get stripped back to the fundamentals and get that as core in our practice.</p>
								<p>And then we have to understand the reasons why we're fearful. So fear is a really massive thing, isn't it? Because we can learn all about the physiology and we can have all the information at our fingertips. But if we're afraid in practice, if we feel anxious about what we're doing on a day-to-day basis. And that might be because the woman's asking for something that we're unsure of, or it might be that we work in a really technocratic organization. Or that there's a there's somebody who's bullying us on a clinical placement or someone who we work with, that's not allowing the woman to respect physiology. You know, there's all kinds of things come into play here.</p>
								<p>But fear underpins everything. And again, Hannah Dahlen has written a lot about fear. And, you know, some of the most amazing papers. I would suggest to your readers, that your listeners, that they Google Hannah Dahlen and fear, and they will come up with some beautifully written papers, that help you, that helped me to understand the difference between real fear when you have to act on something very quickly, because something is going wrong. Just as you would if you were crossing a road and a car was coming. And manufactured fear, were you making it up? Were you thinking, &ldquo;Oh, if I don't do that, that might happen&rdquo;. Or, &ldquo;If I don't do that, I might get into trouble&rdquo; or, you know, we do it in our personal lives as well. In the night I wake up and start to manufacture things that are going to happen. And actually, they don't come to pass, you know, those things don't happen, but I'm worried about it.</p>
								<p>So it's the same in practice, and Hannah has written one paper with another Australian midwife and can't remember her name. But actually, if you want to find it, Sue Downe and I edited a book called "Squaring the Circle". In that book, Hannah has written a chapter with others about fear.&rsquo;And she&rsquo;s listed that paper and she's written a section, &lsquo;What midwives can do: 1-2-3-4-5-6 to reduce fear. And those things are things like; if you're worried about any particular procedure, or anything that I'm dreading. If a woman comes in with PT, for example. Learn about it, make that a mission to learn about it. But that's just one of the things and it's a great kind of like memoir of things that you can do to reduce your fear. So that would be another thing. Think about why you're fearful and act on it.</p>
								<p>And then, you know, get like small things like setup a book club. If you've got likeminded people that you work with, who wants to improve their, the normal birth rates and you know, not reducing caesarean section but improving your normal birth rates - optimizing opportunities for women to give birth, physiologically. Then set up a little group with your peers and set up a book club and choose a book that you're going to read and then feed it back to each other. Choose a chapter each and you know those things.</p>
								<p>I did that in practice, and it really, really helped me and then if you see somebody who's working to optimize physiology, ask them to teach others. Lift them up, you know, don't like criticise them.</p>
								<p>Because very often when we get into clinical spaces, the midwives who are seen as the ones who are maybe working hard to promote normal birth is sometimes seen as deviant. And they&rsquo;re sometimes seen as &lsquo;oh she's one of those,&rsquo; you know. I was always seen as one of those. And actually, I'm really proud of it now that I was, because I became the head of midwifery eventually.</p>
								<p>And so, you know, I just worked with women. And so, I just think that, you know, it lifts them up, instead of pulling them down. Lift them up and give them something to be proud of. One of your midwives you've got working in your organization, Marcia Morris, is somebody that I talk about all the time. And it was just one particular birth. I actually wrote about this incident in my, in my memoir, which is "Catching Babies". And the reason why I wrote about it was, because it had a significant impact on my life. And, and now I'm hearing things all the time. And this happened 20 years ago.</p>
								<p>And in in our maternity unit, this happened, and yet now even now, this seems impossible in some maternity units, and it's just intriguing. Anyway, this is the story, very quickly:</p>
								<p>I went to see a woman who (no I didn't), I was contacted. I was a manager at the time and one of the midwives, this community midwife, contacted me to say that a woman had come to clinic and the midwife had diagnosed that she was having a breech baby was presenting breech. And as soon as she told the woman, the woman, she got off the bed and shouted, she was really aggressive. And said to the midwife, &ldquo;I'm not coming back, I won't be coming back here. I'm not. Don't contact me, I am never coming to see a midwife again, or a doctor. I'm going home, don't try and contact me.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>Anyway, long story short after discussion with supervisors of midwives, and my head of midwifery and everything with the decision was that I should go and see this woman I should present myself and see her. And the way I did it was, first of all, I called her and she wouldn't speak to me, and quite rightly, she had every right not to, not to speak to us.</p>
								<p>As I said, this is 20 odd years ago. And then what I did then is I went to see my mentor friend, she said, &ldquo;Just try Sheena, just try and do a home visit and see.&rdquo; So when I appeared on her doorstep. Her doorstep was very high up. And I remember, she opened the door. And I told her who I was, and she said, "I told you not to come" and she started to shout at me. And I said, I'm really, really sorry to impose on your life. But I'm just here to listen, I'm not here to say anything. You know, if you would allow me to hear what you have to say why you're so angry and so afraid, then I promise you, I promise you I will not speak. I'll just sit out or sit or stand and I won't speak. And so she looked at me and then she said come in. And I was so frightened, honestly, because she was just quite a big woman, I mean tall. And she was already on a high step. And she took me into her house and she was really loud and angry. And so I sat on the sofa, the edge of the sofa, she allowed me to sit down and I sat down. And she told me why she was so angry.</p>
								<p>And she was shouting when she was telling me and she'd actually had a caesarean section for breech with the first baby. And she was in a violent relationship. And so her partner was beating her constantly and when she couldn't look after the baby, he beat her afterwards. And when she could because she'd had a caesarean, then she found out that actually she might not have needed the caesarean and that there was a chance that she could have had the baby vaginally. So that made her angry against the hospital.</p>
								<p>And she didn't know enough to comprehend the whole situation. But she was angry. And then she had her second baby. And because she'd had a caesarean, she was given another caesarean. And even though it was vaginal, it was head down. Cephalic.</p>
								<p>And so, she began and again, she was in another relationship, another violent relationship and she couldn't look after her children. So she said she wasn't going to have a caesarean. So that was a reason.</p>
								<p>So I just said, I just sat and listened again and just said, okay, and, and then she said, and so I said, "You want me to leave now?" And she said, "Well, what are you going to do about it?" So I said, "Well, I'd like to offer my help." So I said, &ldquo;I'd like to say that if you don't want to go to hospital, you can have your baby here,&rdquo; you know, and she said, &ldquo;What even if it's breech?&rdquo;</p>
								<p>I said, &ldquo;Yeah, we'll look after you. You know, I'll speak to the team. And we'll look after you at home if that's what you want. If you don't want to go to hospital, I'm not going to hospital. I'm not going so that's fine, we'll help you.&rdquo; So she said, &ldquo;Can you do that?&rdquo;</p>
								<p>And I said, &ldquo;I'll try&rdquo; and she said, &ldquo;Well you can go now, and you can come back next week.&rdquo; So that was a big thing. You know, like I've made a step in. So I left and I went back and spoke to the team. And then I said so I had a meeting with the midwives. And I said, right, this is the situation in this area is anybody willing to look after this woman at home and really brush up their skills on breech birth, and we'll put a plan in place. And we'll get, we'll get everybody sort of alerted to this situation, we'll have an ambulance outside, we'll get the doctors primed up, we'll you know.</p>
								<p>Marcia said, &ldquo;I'll do it.&rdquo; Marcia said, &ldquo;I'll do that.&rdquo; And so honestly, makes me want to cry, she said, I'll do that- I was actually going on holiday. And so, I couldn't be there. But she did, she took charge of the situation. And she said, &ldquo;You know, I'll make sure that I do all this.&rdquo; So she did, she had a plan. And she did, she brushed up on her skills, and she did everything. And I went to see the woman the week after I told her, and then she let me listen into her baby. Then we introduced her to Marcia. And in the end, Marcia cared for this woman, the baby wasn't breach in the end, and she had a baby at home. But what she did is she, she listened to the woman, she took on board all the issues, and she managed the risk. We all manage the risk together, she was supported. So I'll never forget what Marcia did.</p>
								<p>And I might have got that slightly wrong, you know, because it's a long time ago. But I don't think I have. I might have got a tiny little bit. You know, she might say, &ldquo;Oh no, that didn't happen.&rdquo; But I'm sure it did.</p>
								<p>But yeah, so I think that we all have to be courageous, don't we? We have to be courageous. We need support to be courageous, that we have to face the fear and do it anyway.</p>
								<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> And this is back to what you were saying about the MGP&rsquo;s in the group practices. Because when you have a great team, you get great outcomes. Because your team come together. And that's where I think you're absolutely correct with what they're looking at models, because I think team teamwork is the key. Absolutely the key - sorry, I stopped you because that was amazing story. I went goose pimply when you were telling me.</p>
								<p><b><span class="guest">Sheena:</span></b> Me too! I still get tears in my eyes. Because it meant so much to me, you know, that, that kind of standing up and saying, I'll do it. You know? I'll do that. And we'll all work together, and the doctors worked with us, you know, and the ambulance, you know, the ambulance was, was ready. You know, we all did it together. So that this woman who'd been oppressed, she was totally oppressed in her life. She was the saddest, saddest woman. And yet, we rallied around her and gave her what she wanted, and we had a brilliant head of midwifery as well.</p>
								<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> So yeah, that was really good.</p>
								<p>I'm very conscious of the time for you. But I just want to ask you one more question. I'm going to ask all the panel members this, I just think with all your expertise, what advice or pearls of wisdom would you give to our up and coming midwives of the future? I mean, you've given us several today in your conversation. But is there any one thing you'd like to pass on to people?</p>
								<p><b><span class="guest">Sheena:</span></b> Yes, there is, absolutely. So I would say, remember why you wanted to do the job in the first place. Keep it close in your heart, right? So if you wrote it down, if you have a personal statement that you wrote to become a midwife, keep it safe in a drawer somewhere, or on your laptop. And read it from time to time and keep those values with you all the time.</p>
								<p>Try not to fit into negative cultures. So once you become a midwife, I mean, it happens when you are student midwives as well. But once you become a midwife, it's very easy to want to fit in. And sometimes those negative cultures permeate through maternity services, I think they're doing health services in general, and in anywhere you work.</p>
								<p>But it's very difficult to not be part of that. And sometimes when you're practicing, and so for example, you'll go on a shift and you'll see that some of the midwives who maybe are in a clique, that are talking about things that they've done and maybe rolling their eyes at someone that's working. Or criticizing a woman that's being cared for, and, you know, some kind of situation that's kind of happening and being unkind, generally.</p>
								<p>And it's kind of like this negativity, that seems to breed and, and try not to join in with it. So saying things like, "Did you really mean to say that?", if you hear someone criticizing another? And "do you think she would like to hear you saying that" or &ldquo;do you think he would like to hear you saying that?&rdquo; If they're criticizing, say a junior doctor or something for fumbling or whatever. There's always these little nit-picking things happening. And just try to lift yourself above that. And it's not easy. It's hard to be different. But, if you keep those values close to your heart, then you won't go far wrong. You won't always get it right. But if you just keep aiming for that, then I think that helps.</p>
								<p><b><span class="host">Sue:</span></b> That's a fabulous way for us to finish our conversation and thank you. That was great. I mean I could talk... I'd really like to thank you so much for your time and it's been fantastic.</p>
